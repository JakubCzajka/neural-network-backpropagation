# Machine learning

Machine learning is a part of computer science dedicated to creating and understanding structures and algorithms that can improve themselves - in a process similar to humans learining things as they grow. This field of study is closely related to statistics, and finds applications in many not computers-related fields such as medicine, astronomy or agriculture.

There are 3 main approaches to machine learning:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

## Supervised learning
In this approach the model is built upon dataset that contains inputs and desired outputs. The model is supposed to discover rules that connect inputs and outputs. This requirement renders a huge drawback - training data has to be labeled by humans.

This is the approach that will be used in this program. More specifically the model will be able to learn using datasets that contain numerical-only inputs and one output - record's class. Example of such dataset is the iris dataset.
